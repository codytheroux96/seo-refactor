# Seo-refactor

## Description
For this assignment I had to take previously written code and make it more semantic and SEO friendly. First I wanted to make sure that all of the internal links worked correctly which one did not (search engine optimization). In order to achieve that I went to where it was declared as a class and changed it as an ID to match the link in the navbar. Second, I changed the div into the navbar into just nav and then deleted the unordered list and changed the CSS accordingly. I then took out the h2 in footer. Next with the class labeled content I changed that div to a figure. After that I took out the class called content and replaced it with the tag "main" and started working from there. The 3 bigger sections labeled "Search Engine Optimization" "Online Reputation Management" and "Social Media Marketing" I used h2 and article to define that area and consolidated everything I could that had the same settings in my CSS page. For the part on the right hand side of the screen that has the 3 headers labeled "Lead Generation" "Brand Awareness" and "Cost Awareness" I put that under the Section tag, labeled all those headers as h3 and again consolidated my CSS accordingly. Just for fun in the paragraph for search engine optimization I threw in the abbr tag for seo.
